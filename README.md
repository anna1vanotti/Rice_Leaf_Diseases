Understanding and analyzing rice leaf diseases is of paramount importance in agricultural research and crop management. 
The health of rice crops directly impacts global food security, as rice serves as a staple for a significant portion of the world's population. Detecting and diagnosing these diseases early through image analysis and machine learning techniques can aid farmers in implementing timely and targeted interventions, minimizing crop losses, and optimizing agricultural yields.

In this project, we implemented a model in Python using convolutional neural networks (AlexNet CNN). 
The model recognizes images of unhealthy rice leaves and classifies them based on the specific diseases they exhibit (Bacterial Blight, Blast, Brown Spots, and Tungro).
